when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow
the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end
many people look but no one ever finds it
when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
